    <!-- Chosen Palette: Scholarly Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is structured into three key, interactive sections to guide the user from a broad overview to specific details. 1) Introduction: Sets the context. 2) Timeline Explorer: Gives a chronological perspective of AI's evolution. This is intuitive for showing the accelerating pace of innovation. 3) Thematic Deep Dive: The core section, which categorizes all 27 papers and resources by topic (e.g., Computer Vision, NLP) for focused learning. This is a far more effective information architecture than a single, flat list. A unified detail modal provides comprehensive information and shows intellectual relationships, preventing visual clutter in the main interface and providing a consistent user flow. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 1) Paper List -> Goal: Organize/Inform -> Method: Thematic card grid using HTML/Tailwind -> Interaction: Filter by category, click for detail modal -> Justification: Allows users to focus on specific AI sub-fields without being overwhelmed by a single long list of 27 items. 2) Chronology -> Goal: Show Change -> Method: Interactive scatter plot timeline via Chart.js (Canvas) -> Interaction: Hover for tooltips, click for details -> Justification: Clearly visualizes the accelerating pace of innovation in deep learning. 3) Paper Relationships -> Goal: Show Connections -> Method: Display related papers directly in the detail modal, linking them by name -> Interaction: Click on a paper card to open the modal and see the connections -> Justification: For a list of 27 papers, a complex visual graph would be visually cluttered and difficult to parse. This simplified, contextual approach provides the same information in a much cleaner, more scalable way. All interactions trigger a single modal for consistency. -->
