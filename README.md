The Complete Sutskever 30: An Interactive Guide to Foundational AI Papers
This project is a single-page interactive web application designed to visualize and explore a curated list of 27 key research papers and resources that are considered foundational to modern deep learning. The list is based on a claim by AI pioneer Ilya Sutskever that a deep understanding of these works is crucial for anyone entering the field.

The application translates this list into an intuitive, interactive experience, allowing users to explore and synthesize the information through a thematic deep dive and an interactive timeline.

Features
Thematic Deep Dive: Explore papers organized by their core research areas, such as Computer Vision, NLP, and Scaling & Optimization.

Interactive Timeline: A dynamic scatter plot that visualizes the publication year of each paper, revealing the accelerating pace of AI research.

On-Demand Details: Click on any paper to view its authors, a summary, and its intellectual relationships with other works in a clean, comprehensive pop-up modal.

Fully Self-Contained: The entire application runs from a single HTML file, with no backend or server-side code required.

How to Use
Filter by Category: Use the buttons in the "Thematic Deep Dive" section to explore papers by their specific research field.

Navigate the Timeline: Hover over data points on the timeline chart to see the paper's title, or click on a point to open its full details in the modal.

Explore Connections: Within the modal, see which other papers are related to the one you're viewing.

Technologies Used
HTML: Provides the core structure and content of the web page.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first framework used for a clean, responsive, and modern user interface.

JavaScript: Powers all the application's interactivity, including content filtering, state management, and modal handling.

Chart.js: Used to create the dynamic and interactive timeline visualization.

Hosting
Since this is a single HTML file with no backend dependencies, it can be hosted on any static web hosting service. Simply upload the index.html file to platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel to make it publicly accessible.
